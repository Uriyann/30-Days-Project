# 🚀 30 Days – 30 Projects (HTML • CSS • JavaScript)

A self-paced **30-day front-end challenge** where I build **one project per day** using **HTML, CSS, and beginner-level JavaScript**.  
The goal of this challenge is to **improve consistency, strengthen fundamentals, and gain confidence in JavaScript through hands-on projects**.

After completing this challenge, all projects will be showcased on a **main portfolio website**.


## 🧠 What I’m Learning
- HTML structure & semantics
- CSS layouts, animations, and responsiveness
- JavaScript fundamentals (DOM manipulation, events, logic)
- Problem-solving through real projects
- Building habits through daily practice


## 🛠 Tech Stack
